# View a multicall proposal
After creating a proposal, the next step is for other DAO members to review it and vote on it. However, the way multicall proposals are displayed on AstroDAO (or other generic DAO frotends) isn't human-friendly. As an example, can you tell what the following proposal does?

## Visualizing proposals

It is **really** important to understand proposals before voting on them. Hence, the need to parse their arguments and display them in a more intuitive way. You can use the multicall UI to visualize a proposal by just copying the proposal's link and pasting it into the "**load from proposal**" dialog. The following GIF demonstrates that:

```admonish hint
We currently support proposal links from both [AstroDAO](https://astrodao.com/) and the base [Sputnik UI](https://v2.sputnik.fund/).
We're also open to supporting more UIs as well, so send us your suggestions!
```

Another use case for this feature is the creation of templates: If you want to create a proposal that's very similar to another proposal that you or someone else made in the past (regardless of which DAO it happened on), then why start from scratch? Instead, load the old proposal and apply your changes on top of it.
